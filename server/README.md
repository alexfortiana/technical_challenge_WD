# The Phone Cave (WD)

At The Phone Cave we are looking for someone to help us turn our cave store into a home, and to do so we present you this challenge.

## The challenge (first 3 hours)

Your task consists of creating an app showing our  catalog. Follow the steps detailed below to complete the task. You have 3 hours to do so.

### First iteration

Write an API REST NodeJs that meets the following requirements:
- One endpoint /telephones
- Return the attached load "phones.json"

### Second iteration

Write a React application that shows the API you created before. Everything should be doen with hooks.
- Use Axios (or a similar library) in order to obtain data from the API REST.
- Show a list with all the telephones.
- When a phone model is selected from the list, a detailed view of the phone is shown with a few specific details displayed. This display should be on the same page than the list of phones. 
- Show a spinner component or a position marker while the API request is processing (display a simulation if there is no loading time)

### Third Iteration

Make it look acceptable. There is no need to develop a sophisticated design, but it should not look terrible when viewed from a phone. Add images of each device.


Once done with this, do a pull request to submit your work. 


## Deadlines

We want to see a pull request three hours after the challenge has started. The basic goals described in the first part of this challenge (The Challenge)

In the event that after three hours you do not have the MVP objectives ready, send the pull request indistinctly. This is a speed challenge.

To start with the challenge make a fork of the repo and to submit it don't forget to pull request it. Write a good Readme.MD, if you don't attach the instructions to run the repo your candidacy will be invalidated.
